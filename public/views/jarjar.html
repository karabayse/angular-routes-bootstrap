<h3>Jar Jar Binks first appears in Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace as
   a bumbling, foolish Gungan from the planet Naboo. He is nearly killed by a
    Federation transport, only to be saved at the last minute by Jedi Knight
     Qui-Gon Jinn. Qui-Gon and his padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi, persuade Jar Jar's
      tribe to release him to their custody as a guide. He later goes with the
       Jedi and Padmé Amidala to the planet Tatooine, where he meets and
        befriends Anakin Skywalker.</h3>
